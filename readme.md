## W3Develops Cohort Wiki

This repo is the centralized location for the [Cohort Wiki](https://github.com/w3develops/cohort-wiki/wiki). This wiki is intended to provide Cohort
teams with information to help them jump start their Cohort Project and to provide guidance on the
various situations they may encounter during the course of the Cohort.

The wiki can be accessed via this repos tab bar:
